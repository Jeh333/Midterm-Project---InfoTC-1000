## Favorite Hobbies

**Music**

Music has always been something that I have found both comforting to listen to and to make. I create music in a DAW named Ableton. I Dj using my turntable and Serato program. I know how to play the guitar, piano, saxophone, and am a decent singer. I love going to festivals and concerts. My first festival was Bonnaroo in 2017, and it created a passionate love. My favorite genres are rock, metal, and EDM. I have a soundcloud page that hasn't been updated in a while. I tend to share my music less and keep it for personal use. But there are some old unrefined tracks that are terrible, but fun to listen to for me. [You can find my soundcloud here!](https://soundcloud.com/jonathan-hatfield-5)

**Gaming**

Gaming has always been my passion. I have gamed since I was little and have always used it as a means of adeventure, relaxation, competetition, and creativity. When I graduated high school I built my first PC when I had enough money. That is when I started making music and streaming. Truthfully, I focused more on these hobbies than I did school. So I dropped out of college. I now have a much better grasp of how to control my passions and not let them drive my motivations away. My favorite games are Old School Runescape, Star Citizen, Overwatch, Path of Exile, and Pokemon.
