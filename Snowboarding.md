## *Snowboarding*

I recently got into snowboarding. There is nothing like getting on the slopes of a mountain at 9am flinging fresh snow. I went to Cooper ski Resort in Colorado and we shredded for seven straight days. We stayed in Leadville, Colorado, which is the highest elvated city in the state. Luckily none of us got altitude sickness. 

 I recently purchased a snowboard in June while they were on sale. It has been sitting in my closet gaining dust. It saddens me a lot. I will use it eventually! The season is right around the corner!
