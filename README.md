### About Me

I am a student at _Mizzou_ currently. I recently moved to Columbia in January and started to attend as a Junior in the fall of 2022. I currently work at a restaurant called ***Sophia's*** where I am a server. Between work and school there is little time for hobbies and being social. When at home I spend time with my girl friend Hannah and my dog Sammie. We like to game, watch tv, dance, and make music.
