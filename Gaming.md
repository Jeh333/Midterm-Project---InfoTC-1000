## *Gaming*

Gaming has always been my passion. I have gamed since I was little and have always used it as a means of adeventure, relaxation, competetition, and creativity. When I graduated high school I built my first PC when I had enough money. That is when I started making music and streaming. Truthfully, I focused more on these hobbies than I did school. So I dropped out of college. I now have a much better grasp of how to control my passions and not let them drive my motivations away.
